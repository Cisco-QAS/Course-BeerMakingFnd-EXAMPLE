# 🔖  Course Outline

Leverage the `template` directory to define the course outline

> **Course outline** is an overall design of the entire course, modules and topics to cover

# ☑️ Steps to use course outline template 

1. Duplicate the `template` directory for each module in the course outline 
   * Rename *newly duplicated* directory with a shortened version of the course title.
   * Use the [README.md](./template/README.md) file in the *newly created template* folder to define the course outline.
2. Leverage the [assets](./template/assets) directory for any course outline related assets (img, videos, docs ..etc)
3. Use the [final](./template/final) directory to capture the vetted and approved course outline. 


**⚠️ Do not change the content of the `template` folder for consistency**
