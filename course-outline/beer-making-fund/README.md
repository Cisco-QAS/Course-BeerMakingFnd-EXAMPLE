#### ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a <u>Sample Course</u> to showcase the usage of our [learning content template and processÔ∏è](https://github.com/Cisco-Learning/Learning-Content-Template) 
## üìÉ Course Abstract

In this course we will learn the fundamentals of making tasty brew. I would make edits here, and then push my changes back to the repository. :D. Wow that's easy!

## üìê Skill level:
`Foundational`

## üñå Course outline:
### Introduction to Beer Making
**Learning Intent:** `This module we will talk about beer, beer types and science behind brewing`
- What's Beer
- Discuss History of brewing
- Explain Beer styles
- Science behind Beer making
- Cry about GitHub
- This Land is your Land
- What is this stuff


### Selection and milling of grains 
**Learning Intent:** `This module will cover the different types of malts and the process of breaking up the grain kernels in order to extract fermentable sugars to produce a milled product called grist.`
- Discuss different types of malt
- Dive into general fermentation process 
- Explain Importance of sugars in fermentation


### Mash Conversion
**Learning Intent:** `Now that we understand how to produce our grist, this module will cover the brewing process`
- Define Mash
- Discuss the science behind conversion process 
- Cover the breakdown of Malt
- Explain importance of sugar and natural enzymes


### Lautering, Wort boiling and Wort cooling
**Learning Intent:** `In this section we will deep dive into wort creation`
- Discuss the separation process and creation of wort
- Explain the importance of boiling wort 
- Discuss the different types of hops
- Adding hops to wort to make unfermented beer 
- Cooling process and importance of cooling temp 
- **hands on lab**: Interactive - select ingredients used to get wort 


### Fermentation
**Learning Intent:** `Fermentation is an integral part to making beer, let's look at the science behind it and explain how it works`
- Define Yeast and show different types of yeast
- Explain the science behind fermentation (yeast feeding on sugar in wort and producing alcohol in return)
- Discuss how to measure original gravity and final gravity
- **Hand on Lab**: Calculate final gravity from readings


### Maturity and Carbonation 
**Learning Intent:** `Now that we've completed the fermentation process, let's cover the maturity process and carbonation`
- Discuss the importance of maturity to Beer for preservation of flavor and smoothness 
- Explain Maturity process  per Beer style
- Explain cold crashing
- Deep dive into science behind carbonation process 
- **Hand on Lab**: Calculate required PSI for ideal carbonation level per temperature
